## Todo App Api
I'm learning how to create APIs using Go and Gin Framework - Create new Todos, Edit Todos, Delete Todos, get Todos by Status(uncompleted & completed)

## Getting Started
Ensure you have Go installed on your computer

### Install dependencies
After you've successfully cloned the project repository, Go into project directory on your terminal and run the following command

```bash
go get .
```
```bash
go mod tidy
```
### Run the server(localhost:8080)

```bash
go run .
```
## Documentation
See documentation for using the TODO APP API on [Todo Api docs](https://jeager-todo-api.onrender.com/docs).
